# Titanic Kaggle Competition

Solving the Titanic ML problem using Random Forest Classifier and a variety of Feature Engineering mechanisms (including data imputation using SVR).

# The code

The algorithm used to solve the problem is a Random Forest Classifier. Before using it, the data is processed with different techniques and algorithms, including different types of data imputation (using mode, mean and a Support Vector Regression). The features are analysed and plotted using heatmaps and distplots. The majority of the code is feature engineering and data cleaning, munging and preparing.
